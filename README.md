## Can't Stop Driving

##### I encourage you to work on an empty Unity project but if you need to work on the project follow these steps:
1. Install Unity and Git on your computer (obviously).
2. Go inside an empty directory and open a terminal there.
3. Type this command:
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/AllOfTheAbove/CantStopDriving.git
~~~~
4. Open Unity and select your workspace.
5. When you have finished implementing your feature send me your zipped project.

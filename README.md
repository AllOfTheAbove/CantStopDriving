#### Play

Please consider downloading lastest version on [our website]( http://cant-stop-driving.com/play.html).

### Regarding the team

##### I encourage you to work on an empty Unity project but if you need to work on the project follow these steps:
1. Install Unity and Git on your computer (obviously).
2. Go inside an empty directory and open a terminal there.
3. Type this command:
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/AllOfTheAbove/CantStopDriving.git
~~~~
4. Open Unity and select your workspace.
*(If you build from your clone of this repo the multiplayer won't work except in local. Furthermore, in order to have the scoreboard system to work you need to have a proper APISettings.cs. The one in this repo is blank for obvious security concerns.)*
5. When you have finished implementing your feature send me your zipped project (with a detail of modifications, if possible).
